# Vue Tables Materialize CSS

This is a fork of [Vue Tables](https://github.com/matfish2/vue-tables) that is modified to work with [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/).

My intention is to avoid adding/changing/removing any behavior, so the Vue Tables documentation is still valid and should be referenced. The changes to make note of with this fork are as follows:

* The distribution is renamed to vue-tables-materializecss.min.js
* This fork will only target supporting Materialize CSS
* This fork will not be added to NPM, and the NPM information will point to matfish2's package
* This fork will match the release tags with Vue Tables, but apply the necessary changes to support Materalize CSS
